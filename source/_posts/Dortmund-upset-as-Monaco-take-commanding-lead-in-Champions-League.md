#  Dortmund upset as Monaco take commanding lead in Champions League

Just six weeks ago, Borussia Dortmund were sitting pretty atop of the Bundesliga, four points clear of reigning champions Bayern Munich. But an awful run of form has seen them drop down to seventh – just four points above the relegation play-off spot – and they now find themselves on the back foot in their Champions League last 16 tie against Monaco.

 Wednesday’s 3-1 home defeat leaves them requiring a miracle in the return leg if they are to progress to the quarter finals, with Monaco boasting a convincing lead after goals from Kylian Mbappe, Radamel Falcao and substitute sat Shinji Kagawa.

It was Dortmund who started brightly at the Westfalenstadion, but things went downhill for them after Mbappe’s opener in the 18th minute. They created chances but failed to take any of them, and Falcao’s header just before halftime effectively killed off the tie as a contest. Kagawa’s late goal was no more than a consolation.

Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel was scathing in his assessment of his side’s display, telling reporters: “We made so many mistakes you can’t even describe it. We gifted them everything. I don’t know what else to say. It was a terrible game from us.”

It was a bitterly disappointing night for Dortmund, who had been hoping to make amends for their group stage exit last season. Monaco on the other hand will be delighted with how things have gone so far – they now have one foot in the quarter finals and will no doubt be hoping to add Dortmund’s scalp to their collection before the end of this campaign.

#  Dortmund fall to defeat against relegation strugglers Ingolstadt

Dortmund, who have been in fine form of late, suffered a surprise 2-1 defeat away to strugglers Ingolstadt on Saturday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had given the hosts the lead in the first half, but goals from Dario Lezcano and Marvin Matip after the interval secured all three points for the visitors.

It was a real blow for Dortmund, who now find themselves four points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich with just six games remaining. Thomas Tuchel’s side looked off the pace for much of the game and will need to get back to winning ways quickly if they are to have any chance of defending their Bundesliga title.

Ingolstadt, meanwhile, climb out of the relegation zone and up to 16th place. They still have some work to do in order to ensure their survival in the top flight, but this was an important victory nonetheless.

#  Late Lewandowski goal salvages a point for Dortmund

In what was a largely disappointing game for both teams, Borussia Dortmund were able to salvage a point in the 88th minute through a Robert Lewandowski goal. The visitors had the better of the chances throughout the game but were unable to break down a stubborn Werder Bremen defence.

Dortmund started brightly and had the first chance of the game in the 6th minute when Shinji Kagawa hit the post from close range. They went close again in the 15th minute when Jakub Blaszczykowski’s effort was saved by goalkeeper Sebastian Mielitz. Werder Bremen’s first chance of the game came in the 26th minute when Philipp Bargfrede’s shot was tipped over by Roman Weidenfeller.

The visitors continued to dominate possession but were unable to create any clear-cut chances in the second half. In fact, it was Werder Bremen who had the best chances to win the game with both Aaron Hunt and Kevin De Bruyne going close. However, it was ultimately Robert Lewandowski who got on the end of Jakub Blaszczykowski’s cross to score his 8th goal of the season and earn his side a point.

#  Kagawa returns to Dortmund with former club Manchester United

On the 5th of July, Shinji Kagawa returned to Dortmund after 3 years in Manchester United. The Japanese player was unveiled at a press conference and vowed to give his all for his former club. 

Kagawa had mixed feelings about his return, telling reporters that "it was difficult to leave Dortmund in the first place but I have always kept in touch with what has been going on here." He admitted that he had planned to return to Dortmund once his contract with Manchester United expired. 

The player expressed excitement at being able to play alongside new signing André Schürrle and said he hoped they could create "a lot of chances and score a lot of goals" together. Kagawa also praised manager Lucien Favre, calling him a "very good coach who makes sure players are always giving their best." 

Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke expressed his delight at Kagawa's return, saying that "Shinji is one of the most interesting players in world football and we are very pleased that he is back." He added that the club were committed to helping Kagawa regain his best form and hoped he would be able to contribute to more success for the team. 

Kagawa will wear the number 10 shirt for Dortmund and is expected to make his debut for the club in their pre-season friendly against SSV Jeddeloh on July 21st.
