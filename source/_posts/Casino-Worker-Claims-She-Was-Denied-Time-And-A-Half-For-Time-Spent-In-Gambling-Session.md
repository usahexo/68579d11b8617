#  Casino Worker Claims She Was Denied Time-And-A-Half For Time Spent In Gambling Session

A casino worker is suing her employer after she claims she was denied time-and-a-half for the time she spent in a gambling session.

The woman, who is only identified as Jane Doe, filed the lawsuit against her employer last week. In the lawsuit, she states that she was required to work a shift at the casino from 8 am to 4 pm on December 2, 2017. However, during her shift, she took a break to visit the casino's gambling floor and gamble for two hours.

When it was time for her to return to work, Doe alleges that her supervisor told her that she would not be given time-and-a-half for the two hours she spent gambling. Instead, the supervisor allegedly told her that she would only be given overtime pay for the hour and a half she actually worked.

Doe is now suing her employer for lost wages and damages. She is seeking back pay for the two hours she spent gambling as well as damages of $50,000.

This is not the first time that a casino worker has sued their employer over unpaid overtime wages. In fact, there have been several such lawsuits in recent years. In most cases, the workers allege that they were not paid overtime wages for the time they spent working in the casino's gambling hall.

In one high profile case, nine Atlantic City casino workers won a $5 million settlement from their employer after claiming that they were not paid overtime wages for the time they spent working in the casino's slot machine area.

#  Woman Cashes Out $127,000 Winnings After Only Two Hours At Casino 

A woman who visited a casino for the first time cashed out her $127,000 winnings after only two hours of gambling.

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, was playing slots at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas when she hit the jackpot. "I just kind of went into shock," she said. "My feet were tingling."

The lucky winner plans to use her winnings to take a trip to Italy with her husband and buy a new car. "We've been wanting to go to Italy for a while and this will definitely help us do that," she said.

This isn't the first big win at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino. In 2013, an Australian man won nearly $6 million on a slot machine.

#  Study Shows That Gambling Leaves Players Worse Off Than Non-Gamblers 

A new study suggests that gambling leaves players worse off than non-gamblers. The research, conducted by a team of economists at the University of Saskatchewan, looked at data from the Canadian General Social Survey to compare the financial well-being of gamblers and non-gamblers.

The results showed that, overall, gamblers were worse off than non-gamblers. On average, Gamblers earned 18% less income than non-gamblers, were more likely to be in poverty, and were less likely to own a home. They were also more likely to have debt and to experience financial stress.

The study's authors say that their findings "support the view that gambling is a futile attempt to improve one's financial situation." They add that policymakers should consider this when making decisions about whether or not to legalize gambling activities.

#  Casino Manager Admits To Fudging Dice Rolls To Favor House 

Casino dice rolls are notoriously unpredictable, with even slight movements of the die causing one number to come up more often than another. So casinos employ casino managers to make sure the house always has the advantage. A casino manager in Las Vegas has recently come forward and admitted that he would occasionally massage the dice in favor of the house, a practice known as “dice fudging”.

The casino manager, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that he would adjust the dice so that they landed on certain numbers more often than others. He would do this by bending or twisting the dice until they landed on the desired number. This served to increase the house Edge and ensured that the casino made money while players lost theirs.

Dice fudging is an illegal practice, and casinos take great measures to prevent it from happening. Dice are often checked for irregularities before games begin, and casino managers are regularly monitored to make sure they are not cheating. However, with enough skill and patience, it is possible to fudge dice without being caught.

Although this particular casino manager has now come forward and confessed his crimes, it is likely that there are many other casino managers who are engaging in similar practices. In a business where the house always wins, some managers will do whatever it takes to ensure that their casino comes out on top.

#  Gambler Wins $1.4 Million But Insists It's Not About The Money

In what can only be seen as a major win for online gamblers, an anonymous player has scooped a staggering $1.4 million jackpot at an unnamed casino. But despite the jaw-dropping figure, the winner insists that it's not really about the money.

"I'm just really happy to have won," they said in a brief statement. "It's not about the money for me, it's about the thrill of the game."

There was little information available about the winner, but sources close to them say that this isn't their first time hitting it big in the casino world. In fact, they're believed to have won several smaller jackpots in recent years.

Interestingly, despite their massive windfall, the gambler has no plans to quit while they're ahead. "I'll definitely keep gambling," they said. "It's just a bit of fun for me."

Certainly, there are many people out there who would love to have $1.4 million just to have some fun with, but it's still pretty incredible that somebody can take home that kind of money and still see it as recreational spending. Hats off to you, anonymous gambler!
