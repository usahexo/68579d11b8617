#  Rivers Casino is on the Gates of Hell!

I have never gambled in my life, but a friend of mine recommended I check out Rivers Casino. She said it was on the Gates of Hell and that I should definitely go! I was a bit leery at first, but then again – what do I have to lose?

So, on a recent Saturday night, I decided to check out Rivers Casino for the first time. And boy, was she right! As soon as I walked through the doors, it felt like something dark and sinister was waiting for me. The wallpaper had a deep red hue to it, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and alcohol.

I started to feel really uneasy at this point, but I told myself that I needed to soldier on and find my way to the casino floor. And that's when things got REALLY weird. All around me were people playing slot machines, and their faces were just illuminated by the bright screens in front of them. It looked like they were in some sort of trance – like they were being controlled by the demons in charge of Rivers Casino.

I started to panic at this point, and I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. But before I could even take a step, someone grabbed me from behind. It was one of the casino dealers, and he had a wicked smile on his face. He told me that if I wanted to gamble, then he could show me how to do it properly.

I refused, of course, but he didn't take no for an answer. He dragged me over to one of the blackjack tables and started to teach me how to play. At first, I thought he must be an angel sent by God himself to help me get out of this terrible place. But then he started asking for money…and lots of it.

The more money I gave him, the more demonic his smile became. And finally, when I had lost all my cash…he showed his true colours. He cackled insanely and grabbed my arm so hard that it hurt. Then he dragged me towards the entrance of Rivers Casino – right towards the Gates of Hell themselves!

I screamed and fought back as best as I could, but there was nothing I could do against him. He was too strong for me. And finally, after what felt like an eternity, we reached the gates…which opened wide to reveal a ORB OF FIRE that blazed brighter than anything I've ever seen in my life!

The dealer laughed evilly and pushed me into the flames….and that's when everything went black. When I woke up, I was outside Rivers Casino – safe and sound – with no memory whatsoever of what happened inside those demonic walls….

#  Rivers Casino: Enter at your own risk!

Rivers Casino is a casino in Des Plaines, Illinois, United States, with a Gaming floor area of over 136,000 square feet. The casino features 94 table games, nearly 2,000 slots, a 14-table poker room, and a high-limit salon.

The Rivers Casino was opened on July 18, 2011. It is the first riverboat casino in the Chicago area. The casino is owned by Midwest Gaming and Entertainment and operated by their affiliate Gaming and Entertainment Management LLC.

In the early planning stages of the casino's development, there was disagreement between the villages of Des Plaines and Rosemont over where to put it. Rosemont offered a site near O'Hare International Airport while Des Plaines wanted it at the confluence of the Des Plaines and Chicago rivers. After several years of legal battles, Des Plaines won the right to host the casino in 2008.

Almost as soon as it opened, Rivers Casino was mired in lawsuits. In November 2011, nine gamblers filed a class action lawsuit against Rivers Casino for not paying out jackpots worth more than $1 million. In March 2012, four companies that supplied food to the casino filed suit for breach of contract, claiming that Rivers Casino had not paid them for services rendered. And in June 2012, two dealers filed a lawsuit against Rivers Casino for wrongful termination.

Despite these troubles, Rivers Casino continues to be a popular destination for gamblers in Illinois. With its convenient location just minutes from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, it's no surprise that this casino has become one of the most popular gaming destinations in the state.

#  Rivers Casino is infested with demons!

Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh, PA is a hotbed for demonic activity, according to several eyewitnesses.

One brave man, who asked to remain anonymous, says that he was playing the slots when a demon suddenly attacked him from behind. “It was hideous!” he said. “The thing had razor sharp claws and it was trying to drag me down to Hell!”

Other people have seen similar things at the casino. One woman says she saw a group of demons attacking a man, while another person says she saw a demon chasing a small child.

In a statement, the Rivers Casino said that they were aware of the reports of demonic activity and that they were taking precautions to ensure the safety of their guests. They also said that they were working with local authorities to investigate the matter.

So far, no arrests have been made and no concrete evidence has been found to support these allegations. However, with so many witnesses coming forward, it’s hard to believe that something isn’t going on at Rivers Casino.
