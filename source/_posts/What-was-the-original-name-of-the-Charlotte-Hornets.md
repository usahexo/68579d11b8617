The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Hornets have won two championships, both of which came in 1991.

The Hornets were founded as an expansion team in 1988. In their first season, they finished with a record of 20-62, which was the worst record in the league. However, they made significant improvements in subsequent seasons, and in 1991, they reached the playoffs for the first time. They went on to defeat the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the playoffs before upsetting the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. In the NBA Finals, they defeated the Los Angeles Lakers to win their first championship.

The Hornets repeated as champions in 1991-92, defeating the Knicks in five games. However, they were unable to replicate their success in subsequent seasons, and eventually moved to New Orleans in 2002.

In 2014, Charlotte was awarded an expansion team, which assumed the Hornetsâ€™ name and history. The current iteration of the Hornets has yet to win a championship.
