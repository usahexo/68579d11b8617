#  Don't bet on who will win at the Super Bowl - there's money to be made betting on the losers!

Super Bowl betting is always a popular pastime, and with good reason - there's a lot of money to be made. But too many people make the mistake of betting on who will win the game. This is a bad idea, for two reasons.

First, it's incredibly difficult to predict the outcome of the Super Bowl. The best team in the NFL doesn't always win the championship. There are so many factors that go into the game - the condition of the players, how well they're playing on that day, the weather, luck... It's impossible to say for sure who's going to come out on top.

Second, even if you do manage to pick the winning team, you're likely not going to make as much money as you would by betting on the loser. The odds of picking a winner are usually quite low, but the odds of picking a loser are even higher. So if you're looking to make some serious money from your Super Bowl bets, don't put all your eggs in one basket - spread them around and bet on both teams!

#  Betting on the big game? Don't forget to bet on who will come in second!

When betting on the Super Bowl, don't forget to also bet on who will come in second. This is a great way to make some extra money and increase the excitement of the big game.

There are a few different ways to wager on who will come in second. One option is to bet on which team will lose by the smallest margin. Another option is to bet on which team will lose by the most points.

If you're interested in betting on who will come in second, be sure to research the teams and make a well-informed decision. Look at the teams' records, their matchups leading up to the Super Bowl, and their odds of winning. Then make your pick for who will come in second!

#  NFL teams playoff odds: don't bet on who will make it to the Super Bowl

The NFL regular season is coming to a close, which means playoff odds are on everyone's mind. Most sportsbooks have the same four teams favored to make it to the Super Bowl: the New England Patriots, Los Angeles Rams, Kansas City Chiefs, and New Orleans Saints.

However, if you're looking to place a bet on who will make it to the Super Bowl, don't put your money on any of those four teams. All four teams have less than a 50% chance of making it to the big game.

According to most sportsbooks, the Pittsburgh Steelers have the best odds of making it to the Super Bowl at 19%. The next closest team is the LA Chargers at 10%. The Patriots, Chiefs, and Saints all have odds of around 6%.

If you're looking for a dark horse team with good odds of making it to the Super Bowl, consider betting on the Baltimore Ravens. their odds stand at 4%, which may not seem like much, but they're significantly better than the other teams that aren't in one of the top four favorites.

So if you're looking for some good bets leading up to the NFL playoffs, don't put your money on any of the top four favorites. Instead, consider betting on some of the dark horse teams like the Steelers or Ravens.

#  College basketball conference tournament odds: don't bet on who will take home the championship

With the college basketball regular season winding down, it's time to start thinking about who will win their respective conference tournaments. While there are some clear favorites, don't be surprised if a team outside the top of the standings comes away with the title.

In the Big Ten, Michigan State is the heavy favorite. The Spartans are a well-rounded squad that has looked dominant at times this year. They should be able to take care of business in their conference tournament and earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

The ACC is much more wide open, with several teams having a chance to come away with the championship. Virginia is the top seed, but don't count out Duke, North Carolina or Clemson. All four of these teams have shown they can beat anyone on any given day.

In the SEC, Kentucky is once again the favorite. The Wildcats have been up and down this season, but they always seem to find a way to get it done when it matters most. If they can make it to the finals of their conference tournament, they'll be a dangerous team in the NCAA Tournament.

The Pac-12 is also up for grabs, with Arizona State, UCLA and USC all having a chance to win it all. The Sun Devils have been one of the surprise teams in college basketball this year, and they look poised to make a run in their conference tournament.

There are several other teams that could make a run at the title in their respective conference tournaments, including Wichita State in the AAC, Gonzaga in the WCC and Florida State in the ACC. So don't be surprised if someone who isn't currently one of the top seeds ends up winning their conference tournament and earning a trip to March Madness.

#  March Madness has arrived: don't bet on who will be crowned champion

The NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, more commonly known as March Madness, is one of the most popular sporting events in the United States. 64 college basketball teams compete in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. The excitement surrounding the tournament and the potential for Cinderella stories make it a betting favorite among sports fans.

However, picking a champion is not an easy task. In fact, since 2000 only two teams that entered the tournament as a No. 1 seed have gone on to win the championship game. So if you’re thinking about placing a bet on who will be crowned champion this year, think again.

There are plenty of other ways to enjoy March Madness without gambling on the outcome. Here are just a few ideas:

• Watch all of the games: Even if you don’t have a rooting interest in any particular team, watching the games is always exciting. Plus, there are usually some great upset matchups throughout the tournament.

• Cheer on your favorite underdog: Many people love rooting for underdogs, and this is especially true during March Madness. If your favorite team is facing long odds to win it all, make sure to cheer them on!

• Make some brackets: Brackets are one of the best parts of March Madness. See how many correct picks you can make and compare your results with your friends and family members.

• Partake in some friendly wagers: In addition to betting on who will win the championship game, you can also place bets on other aspects of the tournament, such as who will make it to the Final Four or which team will pull off an upset.

No matter how you choose to enjoy March Madness, be sure to have fun and stay safe!
