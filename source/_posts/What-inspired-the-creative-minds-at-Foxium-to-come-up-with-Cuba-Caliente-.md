#  Do you have to be a fan of Benicio Del Toro to enjoy playing Cuba Caliente? 

No, but it helps.

The new game from developer Swift Shift, Cuba Caliente, is out now for iOS and Android devices. If you're a fan of Benicio Del Toro then you're in for a real treat as the actor provides the voiceover for the lead character in the game.

Based on a traditional tile-placing mechanic, Cuba Caliente tasks players with helping Fidel Castro's rebels overthrow his brother's regime. The game takes place over 5 eras, each with its own set of challenges to overcome.

With attractive visuals and a thumping Latin beat providing the backdrop, Cuba Caliente is one of the most fun and enjoyable mobile games I've played in a while. It's not overly challenging so you don't need to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy it, but there's enough here to keep you hooked for hours on end.

#  Are there any secret bonus rounds or features that players should look out for in Cuba Caliente? 

There are a few secret bonus rounds that players can take advantage of while playing Cuba Caliente. One such bonus round is the free spin round, which players can activate by landing three or more scatter symbols on the reels. Free spins can be retriggered during the bonus round, so players could potentially end up with a lot of extra spins.

Another secret bonus round is the wheel bonus. This bonus can be triggered by landing the wheel symbol on reel five. Once activated, players will need to spin the wheel to see what their prize will be. Prizes range from cash prizes to free spins.

Players should also keep an eye out for the jaguar scatter symbol. This symbol can trigger the jaguar bonus round, which awards players with a number of free spins and a multiplier. The multiplier increases with each subsequent spin, so this could be a great bonus round to aim for.

#  How often does Foxium add new games to its library, and is there any chance that Cuba Caliente will be made available on mobile devices in the future?

Foxium is a relatively new software developer, having been founded in 2016. Nevertheless, the company has quickly established itself as a leading provider of innovative and high-quality casino games. Foxium's library currently includes more than 20 games, with new titles being added on a regular basis.

There is no guarantee that Foxium will make Cuba Caliente available on mobile devices in the future, but given the popularity of the game, it's certainly a possibility. In any event, players can rest assured that they can enjoy all of Foxium's other fantastic games on their smartphones and tablets.
