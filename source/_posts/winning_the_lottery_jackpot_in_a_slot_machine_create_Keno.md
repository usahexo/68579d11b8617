# Winning the Lottery Jackpot in a Slot Machine Creates Keno

Have you ever wondered how the popular casino game Keno came into existence? Well, the story goes that in the late 19th century, a Chinese immigrant known as Cheung Leung came up with the idea of Keno to help fund his army during a time of war. But how did he come up with this idea? 

It all started with a game called "baige piao" or "the white pigeon game", which was a popular lottery game in China. This game involved players choosing numbers, and then a drawing would take place where numbered white pigeons would fly out of a metal box. The numbers on the winning pigeons were used to determine which players won the lottery. 

Now, back to Cheung Leung. He wanted to come up with a new game that was similar to baige piao, but that could also generate funds for his army. Cheung Leung's inspiration came from a game called "The Game of One Thousand Characters". In this game, there were 120 characters that players would pick 10 out of, and then a prize was awarded to any player who picked all 10 correctly.

Cheung Leung combined these two games to create Keno. The name "Keno" is derived from a French word "quine", which means "five winning numbers". The original version of Keno had 120 Chinese characters that players would choose from, and 20 characters were randomly drawn. The players who correctly picked the 20 characters would win the game. 

Fast forward to present day, and Keno has evolved into a popular casino game played all over the world. It's fascinating to think that such a simple idea, inspired by a combination of two other games, could become such a beloved pastime for so many people.

But what does winning the lottery jackpot in a slot machine have to do with Keno? Well, the answer lies in the way that modern-day Keno is played in casinos. Instead of using Chinese characters, Keno now uses numbers, much like the lottery. And how were those numbers chosen? 

It turns out that in the 1930s, a man named William "Si" Redd won the jackpot on a slot machine. He used his winnings to develop a new game, which he called "Keno", and it used the same 80 numbers featured on the slot machine. Players would choose numbers, and then a random number generator would select 20 numbers. The more numbers a player correctly chose, the more money they would win. 

So, there you have it! Winning the lottery jackpot in a slot machine helped create the modern version of Keno that we know and love today. Who knows what other brilliant ideas could come from a lucky spin of the reels at the casino? 

In conclusion, Cheung Leung's ingenuity combined with a French word and a man's jackpot winnings led to the creation of Keno, a popular game played in casinos all over the world. Next time you play Keno, take a moment to appreciate the brilliant minds that came up with this game and the unusual events that shaped its evolution.
