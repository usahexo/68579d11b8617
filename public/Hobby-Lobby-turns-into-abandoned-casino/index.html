        <h1 id="Hobby-Lobby-turns-into-abandoned-casino"><a href="#Hobby-Lobby-turns-into-abandoned-casino" class="headerlink" title="Hobby Lobby turns into abandoned casino"></a>Hobby Lobby turns into abandoned casino</h1><p>Hobby Lobby, once a bustling casino and one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area, is now abandoned and in disrepair. The casino closed its doors to the public over a decade ago and has sat vacant ever since.</p>
<p>The building is falling apart, with parts of the roof caving in and the windows broken. Weeds grow through the cracks in the pavement and vines cover the walls. The only things that remain are the memories of what once was.</p>
<p>Many people have shared their memories of Hobby Lobby online, including former employees who worked there for many years. One employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said:</p>
<p>“It was a great place to work. We had a lot of fun and I made some great friends. I still miss it sometimes.”</p>
<p>Others recall the great deals they found at Hobby Lobby, or the time they won big at the casino. But no matter what their memories may be, everyone seems to agree on one thing - that it’s sad to see such an iconic building fall into disrepair.</p>
<h1 id="Trump’s-abandoned-casino-a-gaming-ghost-town"><a href="#Trump’s-abandoned-casino-a-gaming-ghost-town" class="headerlink" title="Trump’s abandoned casino: a gaming ghost town"></a>Trump’s abandoned casino: a gaming ghost town</h1><p>Atlantic City’s Trump Taj Mahal casino closed its doors in October of 2016 after 26 years of operation. At the time, it was the fifth Atlantic City casino to close since 2014. Now, nearly two years later, the property remains abandoned and largely untouched.</p>
<p>The Trump Taj Mahal was the most costly casino ever built in Atlantic City, and it quickly became one of its most popular destinations. But after filing for bankruptcy in 2009, Trump Slot Holdings – the company that owned the casino – lost control of it to Carl Icahn. Icahn planned to close the casino in order to avoid paying union employees’ health and retirement benefits.</p>
<p>However, following protests from both workers and New Jersey politicians, Icahn reached an agreement with the union that kept the casino open. In return, workers agreed to reduced benefits and a wage freeze.</p>
<p>But by 2016, it was clear that the Trump Taj Mahal could no longer compete with casinos in neighboring states. After several unsuccessful attempts to sell the property, Icahn closed it down.</p>
<p>Now, theTrump Taj Mahal is just another abandoned casino in Atlantic City. The gaming floor is still filled with slot machines and blackjack tables, but they’re now covered in dust and spider webs. The only noise coming from the property is the sound of wind blowing through broken windows and doors.</p>
<p>Despite its closure, the Trump Taj Mahal still owes millions of dollars in taxes to Atlantic City and various state and local agencies. In addition, there are currently two lawsuits pending against Trump Slot Holdings alleging breaches of contract and fraud.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what will happen to the Trump Taj Mahal now that it’s been abandoned for two years. Some experts say that it could be turned into a hotel or conference center, while others believe it will eventually be demolished.</p>
<h1 id="The-dark-spooky-world-of-abandoned-casinos"><a href="#The-dark-spooky-world-of-abandoned-casinos" class="headerlink" title="The dark, spooky world of abandoned casinos"></a>The dark, spooky world of abandoned casinos</h1><p>For those who love a good scare, abandoned casinos are the perfect place to explore. Once filled with vibrant lights and people making merry, these spaces now echo with emptiness and promise of danger.</p>
<p>Casinos are often abandoned for a few reasons. The first is natural disaster. If a fire or hurricane hits a casino, it’s likely to be abandoned quickly as the damage is too costly to repair. Another reason is financial trouble. If a casino goes bankrupt, it’s often left to rot. And finally, when casinos get too old they’re often demolished and replaced with something new.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, when a casino is left to fade away it becomes a spooky place full of secrets and dark corners. Many of these casinos are in the middle of nowhere, making them even creepier to explore.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an adventure and some thrills, consider exploring an abandoned casino. Just be careful not to get too spooked!</p>
<h1 id="An-explorer’s-guide-to-abandoned-casinos"><a href="#An-explorer’s-guide-to-abandoned-casinos" class="headerlink" title="An explorer’s guide to abandoned casinos"></a>An explorer’s guide to abandoned casinos</h1><p>Exploring abandoned casinos can be a fun and exciting activity, but it’s important to be aware of the dangers involved. This guide will provide you with all the information you need to have a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to know where to find abandoned casinos. They can be found in any city, but they’re typically located in more rural areas. The best way to find them is to do a Google search for “abandoned casino” + [city name].</p>
<p>Once you’ve located an abandoned casino, it’s important to exercise caution before entering. There is always the risk of getting injured or lost inside, so it’s critical that you take the time to assess the situation before going in. If there are any signs of damage or trespassing, it’s best to avoid the casino entirely.</p>
<p>If everything looks safe, then you’ll want to prepare for your exploration by dressing appropriately. Wear sturdy shoes and clothing that can protect you from potential hazards, such as broken glass or nails. It’s also a good idea to bring a flashlight and some binoculars, so you can see everything clearly and avoid potential danger zones.</p>
<p>Now that you’re prepared, it’s time to explore! Begin by exploring the exterior of the casino. Pay close attention to the condition of the building and look for any clues as to what might have happened there. If anything looks suspicious or dangerous, avoid entering the casino.</p>
<p>Once you’ve explored the outside, it’s time to head inside. Be very careful when entering – there is always the risk of collapsed ceilings or floors. Make your way through the casino slowly and cautiously, taking note of any interesting features along the way.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling adventurous, you can try exploring some of the upper levels of the casino. But be warned – these areas are often very unsafe and can be quite dangerous. Exercise extreme caution if you choose to explore them!</p>
<p>When you’re finished exploring, make sure you take plenty of pictures and notes so that you can remember your adventure forever! Then safely make your way back out of the casino and enjoy telling everyone about your exciting adventure.</p>
<h1 id="Left-behind-exploring-forgotten-casino-resorts"><a href="#Left-behind-exploring-forgotten-casino-resorts" class="headerlink" title="Left behind: exploring forgotten casino resorts"></a>Left behind: exploring forgotten casino resorts</h1><p>Las Vegas is a city that has been built and rebuilt time and time again. Each iteration has left its own mark on the city, with some areas being favored more than others. One aspect of the city that often gets left behind is the casino resorts located on the outskirts of town. While these resorts may not offer the same level of excitement as those in the heart of the Strip, they offer an interesting look at what Vegas used to be like.</p>
<p>One such resort is the Sahara, which was located on Las Vegas Boulevard just south of the Strip. The Sahara was originally opened in 1952 as a small motel, but it was later expanded into a full-fledged casino resort. The Sahara was one of the first resorts to offer roller skating, and it became popular with families looking for a place to visit outside of the casinos.</p>
<p>The Sahara underwent several expansions over the years, but it ultimately fell victim to competition from newer and flashier resorts. It closed down in 2011, and most of its contents were auctioned off. Today, all that remains of the Sahara is its sign, which is now a landmark in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Another casino resort that has been largely forgotten is Stardust Resort and Casino. The Stardust was located east of the Strip, and it originally opened in 1958 as a hotel and casino. The Stardust was well known for its sci-fi theme, which included a large space ship protruding from its roof. In addition to its theme, the Stardust was also known for its gambling floor, which was one of the largest in Las Vegas at the time.</p>
<p>The Stardust underwent several expansions over the years, but it ultimately fell victim to competition from newer resorts. It closed down in 2007, and most of its contents were auctioned off. Today, all that remains of the Stardust is its sign, which is now a landmark in Las Vegas.</p>
